# this is to determine minimum spanning tree in a graph-UNDIRECTED
# Remove all loops and parallel edges from the graph, parallel- remove the larger weighing edge
# sort edges according to weught
# start with lowest weighing edge 
# form a tree making sure that any edge addition should not create a cycle
# n nodes in graph, = n nodes in MST and n-1 edges
